# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview

An interactive data visualization for the web. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a dashboard that research volunteers could use to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.

## Technology Used

- Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, was used to create an interactive data visualization for the web. Plotly was used to create basic plots that included bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
- D3.json() was used to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
- Data was parsed in JSON format.
- JavaScript functional programming was used to manipulate data.
- JavaScript's Math library was used to manipulate numbers.
- JavaScript's event handlers were used to add interactivity to a data visualization.

## Challenge Deliverables

#### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

The following horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The chart displays the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

#### Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart 

The following bubble chart displays the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage: 

- The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
- The sample_values as the y-axis values.
- The sample_values as the marker size.
- The otu_ids as the marker colors.
- The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

#### Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart

The following gauge chart displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
